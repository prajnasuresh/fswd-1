        In these torrid times, our doctors and nurses have been serving day and night, like the soldiers who guard our borders, to protect millions of lives.<br></br>
From being witnesses to so many deaths around them to working tirelessly without a break to getting themselves self-quarantined due to the fear of taking the virus home, the doctors and nursing staff were driven to the breaking point many a times during the pandemic.<br><br> It has been an emotionally and physically exhausting journey for doctors and healthcare-workers – both at the personal and professional level.<br><br>In order to show our respect and express gratitude towards them we continue to celebrate them for their unconditional service.</blockquote>
